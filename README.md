# Spotify React Web Player

This spotify web player app connects to the spotify web api and allows user to connect using authorization tokens to their spotify account.  They are then redirected to a dashboard page which shows a search bar and player at the bottom and allows users to search for artists, songs, lyrics, etc. with a new array of items being populated. These items are taken directly from the spotify web api and when chosen, the web player begins to play the song on screen. This is mostly responsive besides the volume scroller on smaller devices due to the library I used for the playback.  This uses bootstrap css for styling and a react app for the client side.  The server side is hosted on heroku and uses axios, express, and a nodejs spotify web playback library. Thanks for checking it out!
